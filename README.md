# Phibo MA SAR

Phibo MA SAR is a custom indicator developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. This indicator is based on the Phicube methodology and is designed to identify trend reversals in the market.

## Features

- Moving Average (MA) period: The user can customize the period for the Moving Average calculation.
- SAR step: The user can adjust the step value for the SAR calculation.
- SAR maximum: The user can set the maximum value for the SAR calculation.

## Indicator Initialization

The indicator initialization function, OnInit(), allocates memory for the lines array and sets the indicator buffers. It also sets the indicator name and the number of decimal places for the instrument.

## Indicator Calculation

The indicator iteration function, OnCalculate(), calculates the MIMA SAR lines for each candle in the chart. It calls the CalculateMIMASAR function to calculate the Moving Average and SAR values and stores them in the lines array. If a trend reversal is detected, the PerformTradingActions function is called to execute trading signals.

## CalculateMIMASAR Function

The CalculateMIMASAR function calculates the Moving Average and SAR values based on the user-defined parameters. It stores the SAR value in the lines array and updates the last position in the array. If the maximum number of lines is reached, it resets the last position. It also checks for trend reversals by calling the IsTrendReversal function.

## IsTrendReversal Function

The IsTrendReversal function checks if at least five lines in the lines array are aligned in a certain direction. If five or more lines are aligned, it returns true, indicating a trend reversal.

## PerformTradingActions Function

The PerformTradingActions function checks if all lines in the lines array are aligned either upwards (pure uptrend) or downwards (pure downtrend). Based on the detected trend, it calls the BuySignal or SellSignal function to place the corresponding trading signal.

## BuySignal and SellSignal Functions

The BuySignal and SellSignal functions are placeholders for executing buying and selling signals, respectively. Users can customize these functions to implement their own trading strategies.
